				<img id="profile-image" src="../assets/me.jpg" alt="Me" />
				<p>I'm 24 years old and I'm a life-long resident of Boston/Somerville, MA. I attended Brandeis University in Waltham, MA, where I earned both a BA and an MA in philosophy. My dream was to become a professor of philosophy, but I had to put that on the backburner for a variety of personal and socioeconomic reasons. Chances are I'd have to move far away for work and I can't do that at this point in my life. Some day, I'd like to pursue a PhD and gain a teaching position. But for now, I'd like to pursue a career in something I enjoy that allows me to stay in the area.</p>
				<p>In addition to doing the web development certificate program at UML, I'm currently working as a tutor. I tutor students in algebra, geometry, philosophy, theory of knowledge, and ethics. It's no college course, but I still enjoy the experience of sharing knowledge.</p>
				<p>I spend some of my free time in ways that most people spend theirs, like playing video games, hanging out with friends, binging on Netflix, plying sports, etc. But I also like to spend a lot of my free time programming. I used to code in Java in high school and a little in college. These days I work with Ruby and PHP (though I strongly dislike PHP). So far, I've written a few methods here and there, but nothing in the way of full web apps yet. The goal for the next six months is to get to that first fully-functional, nontrivial web app.</p>

				<h2 class="center-text">Portfolio (of Sorts)</h2>
				<p>Below are a few of my first attempts at web design and development. I did these while working part-time for a friend's company. We worked mostly with restaurants in the Greater Boston area as a merchant services provider and the websites were kind of a side project we took on for a little extra revenue. I enjoyed it so much that I've started to pursue web development as a potential career.</p>
