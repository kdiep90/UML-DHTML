				<h2 class="center-text">Just kidding...</h2>
				<p>
					With regards to the question of whether or not it is appropriate to utilize non-standard additions to HTML, I think that as with many things, there is a time and a place for it. In an overwhelming majority of cases, standards-compliant code ought to be used as it benefits us in terms of economic expedience, i.e. it takes less time for testers and other reviewers to look over and edit standards-compliant code and therefore costs less time and money to get up and running. I'd like, as a developer, to be able to read a peer's code, written two months ago, in a different work environment, on any currently popular browser. Collaboration is a powerful tool for getting things done, especially in this business.
				</p>
				<p>
					It also generally benefits users in that a standardized tool makes for less options for design and use, which in the case of web development is a good thing. While consumers enjoy the freedom of a multitude of options, too many options creates a problem of indecision for them (the paradox of choice). We can see that problem on a small scale today for developers, like when we try to decide which object-oriented language we should use for a particular application. Luckily for us, the range of current options (Ruby, Swift, Java, etc.) allows developers to choose from a set of languages with very distinct advantages (Ruby for readability, PHP for its widespread use, Python for data analysis, and so on). But if the differences were minor, then we'd flounder deciding which is best for the job.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are, though, good reasons and appropriate situations for working with non-standard additions. In fact, I think there is a necessity for the use of non-standard HTML. While it is very efficient for us to work with standard code on a large scale, there is no guarantee that the standards we use now are absolutely the most efficient means for getting the best product. And even if they are for us today, there is also no guarantee that the status quo of the market will remain indefinitely. We might someday find that, yes, we do want flashing text again. Or that future consumers will respond more positively to an actual clicking sound every time they click a link and that we can do that quickly with HTML or some closely related, but non-standard, variant while avoiding using processing time for a JS script (I doubt it's possible, but bear with me for the sake of argument). We need innovation in the industry in order to continue to improve the products and services we as developers provide.
				</p>
				<p>
					While innovation is good, it's not good for everyone to be doing it. Large companies in big markets probably shouldn't be experimenting with non-standard compliant HTML. Smaller companies, with niche markets and the flexibility to adapt to quickly-changing market conditions are perhaps the ideal place for utilizing non-standard code. They serve communities with very specific needs (such as the visually impaired, who probably would need an h .5  and a p-large tag, and have very little effect on the market in general if their code doesn't work very well. If it does work well, then they can share with others without forcing it onto everybody (I'm looking at you, Windows).
				</p>
				<p>
					In the end, I think it's best if we have standards that we can all fall back on, but at the same time, we should be experimenting and looking for the next awesome and super-useful additions to our markup languages.
